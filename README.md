# Melanoma Classification

> Skin cancer detection with artificial intelligence. We analysed different convolutional neural networks for melanoma classification to select the most accurate method for this purpose. In our solution, we used different base models with the same top layers to detect melanoma images from others images.

## General info

Among skin cancer diseases, melanoma is one of the most common and most dangerous ones, being difficult to detect and causing serious problems once spread deeper. Melanomas have many different shapes, sizes, and colours, thus making it harder to provide comprehensive warning signs. Detecting melanoma early is of utmost importance. Neural Networks provide significant progress in this field, making it possible to detect melanomas with many previously learned patterns, dealing with larger datasets than a human specialist can handle.
